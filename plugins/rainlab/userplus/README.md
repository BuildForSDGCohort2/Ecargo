# User Plus+ plugin

This plugin extends the [User plugin](http://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-user) with extra profile fields and features.

* Adds the following extra fields to a user: `phone`, `mobile`, `company`, `street_addr`, `city`, `zip`.
* A user can belong to a Country and/or State, sourced from the [Location plugin](http://octobercms.com/plugin/rainlab-location).

### Potential features

* A user can befriend other users via a friendship system.
* A user can earn "Experience Points" by performing predefined activities.

> Note these features may or may not be implemented in the future, but act only as an indicator of the plugin's potential.
