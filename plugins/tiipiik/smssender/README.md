### **ATTENTION**
If your using Twilio, please make sure your Twilio number is **SMS-enabled** before using it !

As Twilio numbers depends on countries and SMS are not enabled for all of these it could just not work.

### Unicode limit
Due to unicode usage, SMS length is limited to **70** characters instead of 140. I am working on unicode detection to switch on 70 / 140 chars automatically.

### Dashboard Widget
You can add a dashbord widget to get informations about status of messages.

* Number of days to display data for : 0 for the current day, 1 for current day and yesterday, etc.
* Number of row to display : default 10
* Display only failed messages : display only failed messages or all messages
