<b>About our project</b>

The name of our solution is <b>E-Cargo</b>. Our novel solution provides a platform for interconnectivity for the cargo business in Africa.
Our goal is to revitalize the local shipping industry and help cargo owners, drivers and customers alike acheive their aims seamlessly and effortlessly in every locality or country. 
Our first step towards achieving this result was to empower carriers and their drivers, the heart of the trucking industry, with technology to help them succeed. We provide accounts for drivers and clients. Moreover, sign-up is free for everyone!

<b>The E-Cargo platform</b> provides various shippers a direct connection to locate avaliable cargo with the right space to transport their goods, thus enabling them to see instant upfront load pricing, and provide load specifications such as: weight, height, quantity, dimension and category. </br>
The platform is being built in close collaboration with shippers to help transform a process that would typically take them days to complete, and often leave them in the dark about market prices and whether they were getting the right carrier. 

<b>Shippers using E-cargo can:</b>
<b>Tender a load in seconds:</b>
Create and tender loads with just a few clicks and reduce the time and energy it takes to book a cargo.</br>

<b>See instant marketplace pricing:</b></br>
Get instant and transparent price quotes for shipments. E-cargo rates are based on market conditions and other factors and are generated in real-time.</br>

<b>Access E-cargo's reliable network of cargo and drivers:</b> 
  Have peace of mind knowing that all goods tendered through the cargo platform are backed by E-Cargo's vast and reliable network of carriers.

<b>Locate the nearest cargo and track after takeoff:</b></br>
Locate cargo travelling along your path, and track shipments online at any time of day. Automatic notifications for major milestones mean no more searching through an inbox for tracking information.</br>

<b>Streamline document management:</b></br>
Upon delivery, necessary documents are automatically organized and stored for instant and future access.</br>


<b>Why</b>


The problem we set out to solve is that of <b>the need to revitalize and improve Africa's cargo/Shipment industry, and thus make it more attractive and flexible with the intension of generating more income without discouraging clients.</b>


<b>How much impact the product could have in its stated SDG.</b></br>


A core mission of E-Cargo is to create a positive impact on the environment. Sustainability is in the DNA of the entire project. </br>
In the end, we want to sustain cargo owners and drivers in business by creating easy access to clients, and creating employment.</br>
Travelling a long journey with a small quantity of goods means lost revenue.  Why don't we give access to other shippers along the same route?
The end result is that clients can plan the shipment of their goods more holistically.</br>

<b>The launch of E-Cargo will create new avenues for carriers and shippers to achieve their goals.</b></br>
